## Description
This is a planner created using javascript, bootstrap, and moment.js.

## Usage
When the app is deployed, the current time is saved to the top of the page in military time, and time slots are color coded to appear grey (past), red(present time), or green(future). The app will save any typed information inside the text area onto the local storage of the computer if you click save.
